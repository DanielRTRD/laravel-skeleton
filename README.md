## About

This is my personal preference when starting a new Laravel web application. This will minimize my time to get a project up and running. Some config changes has been made from the default installation for one or more of the packages below. This skeleton includes these packages:

Composer:
- [laravel/jetstream](https://github.com/laravel/jetstream)
- [spatie/laravel-permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission)
- [spatie/laravel-honeypot](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-honeypot)
